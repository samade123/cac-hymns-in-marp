# CACGHB 178 - Standing at the portal

1. Standing at the portal
    Of the op'ning year
    Words of comfort meet us
    Hushing ev'ry fear
    Spoken through the silence
    By our Father's voice
    Tender, strong, and faithful
    Making us rejoice


Chorus:
Onward, then, and fear not
Children of the day
For His Word shall never
Never pass away!

---


2. I, the Lord, am with thee
    Be thou not afraid!
    I will help and strengthen
    Be thou not dismayed!
    Yea, I will uphold thee
    With My own right hand
    Thou art called and chosen
    In My sight to stand.

Chorus:
Onward, then, and fear not
Children of the day
For His Word shall never
Never pass away!

---

3. For the year before us
    O what rich supplies!
    For the poor and needy
    Living streams shall rise
    For the sad and sinful
    Shall His grace abound
    For the faint and feeble
    Perfect strength be found.

Chorus:
Onward, then, and fear not
Children of the day
For His Word shall never
Never pass away!

---

4. He will never fail us
    He will not forsake,
    His eternal cov'nant
    He will never break!
    Resting on His promise
    What have we to fear?
    God is all-sufficient
    For the coming year.

Chorus:
Onward, then, and fear not
Children of the day
For His Word shall never
Never pass away!

Amen
