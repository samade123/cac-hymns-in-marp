# CACGHB 100

## King of glory, King of peace

1. King of glory, King of peace,
    I will love thee;
    And, that love may never cease,
    I will move thee,
    Thou hast granted my request
    Thou hast heard me;
    Thou didst note my working breast,
    Thou hast spared me.

2. Wherefore with my utmost art i will sing thee,
    And the cream of all my heart i will bring thee,
    Though my sins against me cried,
    Thou didst clear me,
    And alone, when they replied,
    Thou didst hear me

---

3. Seven whole days, not one in seven,
    I will praise thee;
    In my heart, though not in heav'n,
    I can raise thee.
    Small it is, in this poor sort
    To enrol thee;
    E'en eternity's too short
    To extol thee.

Amen.
