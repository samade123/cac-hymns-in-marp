# CACGHB 044 - O day of rest and gladness

<!-- verse 1 -->
# Verse 1

O day of rest and gladness,  
O day of joy and light,  
O balm of care and sadness,  
Most beautiful, most bright,  
On thee, the high and lowly,  
Through ages join'd in tune,  
Sing Holy, Holy, Holy,  
To God the great Triune.

<!-- verse 2 -->
# Verse 2

On Thee, at the Creation,  
The light first had its birth,  
On thee, for our salvation,  
Christ rose form depths of earth;  
On Thee our Lord victorious  
The Spirit sent form heav'n;  
And thus on Thee most glorious  
A triple light was giv'n

# Verse 3

Thou art a post protected  
From storms that round us rise;  
A garden intersected  
With steams of Paradise;  
Thou are a cooling fountain  
In life's dry dreary sand;  
From Thee, like Pisgah's mountain,  
We view our promised Land.

<!-- verse 4 -->
# Verse 4

Today on weary nations  
The heav'nly manna falls;  
To holy convocations  
The silver trumpet calls,  
Where Gospel-light is glowing  
With pure and radiant beams,  
And living water flowing  
With soul refreshing streams.

# Verse 5

May we, new graces gaining  
From this our day of rest,  
Attain the rest remaining  
To spirits of the blest,  
And there, our voice upraising,  
To father, and to Son,  
And Holy Ghost, be praising  
The blessed Three In One.

Amen.
