    In the fount that flows at the cross so free
    I am washed in the blood of my Redeemer.

Chorus:
    Glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
    I am sav'd from sin and He makes me what I am
    Oh, glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
    I am washed in the blood of my Redeemer.

2. I am saved by grace and to Him bro't near
    I am washed in the blood of my Redeemer
    I would sing so loud that the world might hear
    I am washed in the blood of my Redeemer.

    Chorus:
    Glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
    I am sav'd from sin and He makes me what I am
    Oh, glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
    I am washed in the blood of my Redeemer.

    I am washed in the blood of my Redeemer
    There's a holy joy I can ne'er reveal
    I am washed in the blood of my Redeemer.

    Chorus:
    Glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
    I am sav'd from sin and He makes me what I am
    Oh, glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
    I am washed in the blood of my Redeemer.

4. I will lift my voice while on earth I stay,
    I am washed in the blood of my Redeemer
    Then my soul shall sing in the realms of day
    I am washed in the blood of my Redeemer.

    Glory, glory, glory to the Lamb
    I am sav'd from sin and He makes me what I am
