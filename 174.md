# CACGHB 174 - O GOD, the Rock of Ages

1. O GOD, the Rock of Ages,
    Who evermore hast been,
    What time the tempest rages,
    Our dwelling place serene
    Before Thy first creations,
    O Lord, the same as now,
    To endless generations
    The everlasting Thou!

2. Our years are like the shadows
    On sunny hills that lie,
    Or grasses in the meadows
    That blossom but to die
    A sleep, a dream, a story
    By strangers quickly told,
    An unremaining glory
   Of things that soon are old.

---

3. O Thou, who canst not slumber,
    Whose light grows never pale,
    Teach us aright to number
    Our years before they fail,
    On us Thy mercy lighten
    On us Thy goodness rest,
    And let Thy Spirit brighten
    The hearts Thyself hast blessed.

4. Lord, crown our faith's endeavour
    With beauty and with grace,
    Till, clothed in light for ever,
    We see Thee face to face,
    A joy to language measures,
    A fountain brimming o'er,
    And endless flow of pleasures,
    An ocean without shore.

Amen.
