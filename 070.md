# CACGHB 070 - The God of Abraham praise

## COVENANT 6.6.8.4.D.

### Praise the name of the Lord your God, who hath dwelth wondrously with you. - Joel 2:26

1. The God of Abraham praise,
    Who reigns enthroned above,
    Ancient of everlasting days,
    And God of love,
    Jehovah Great I AM!
    By earth and heaven confess'd;
    I bow and bless the sacred name
    For ever bless'd

---

2. The God of Abraham Praise,
    At whose supreme command
    From earth I rise, and seek the joys
    At His right hand,
    I all on earth forsake
    Its wisdom, fame, and power
    And Him my only portion make,
    My shield and tower.

---

3. He by Himself hath sworn,
    I on His oath depend;
    I shall, on eagle' wings upborne,
    To heaven ascend;
    I shall behold His face
    I shall His power adore,
    And sing the wonders of His grace
    For evermore.

---

4. Though nature's strength decay,
    And earth and hell withstand,
    To Canaan's bound I urge my way
    At His command
    The watery deep I pass,
    With Jesus in my view
    And through the howling wilderness
    My way pursue

---

5. The God who reigns on high
    The great archangels sing;
    And, Holy, holy, holy, cry,
    Almighty King.
    Who was and is the same,
    And evermore shall be;
    Jehovah, Father, Great I AM,
    We worship Thee.

---

6. The whole triumphant host
    Give thanks to God on high;
    Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
    They ever cry.
    Hail. Abra'am's God, and mine,
    I join the heavenly lays;
    All might and majesty are Thine.
    And endless praise.

Amen.
