# CACGHB 366 - When the pow'r of God descended

## O LORD SEND THY POWER 8.7.8.7. and Ref.

## But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you. - Act.1:

---

1. When the pow'r of God descended
   On the day of Pentecost,
   All the days of waiting ended,
   They received the Holy Ghost.

   Chorus:
   O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
   O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
   O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
   And baptize, every one.

---

2. Tongues of flame came down upon them,
   And they preached the word in pow'r,
   List'ning multitudes awaken'd
   Turned to God that very hour.

Chorus:
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
And baptize, every one.

---

3. We are waiting Holy Spirit
   We are all of one accord,
   Lord fulfil just now the promise
   That is given in Thy Word

Chorus:
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
And baptize, every one.

---

4. Fill and thrill us with thy presence,
   Grant the blessing that we need
   Flood our souls with wondrous glory,
   While the pray'r of faith we plead.

Chorus:
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
And baptize, every one.
Amen.
