# CACGHB 571

## Pray always pray; The Holy Spirit pleads

1. Pray, always pray; the Holy Spirit pleads.
	Within thee all thy daily hourly needs.

2. Pray, always pray; beneath sin's heaviest load
	Prayer sees the blood from Jesus' side that flow'd.
---
3. Pray, always pray; though weary, faint, and lone,
	Prayer nestles by the Father's shelt'ring throne.

4. Pray, always pray; amid the world's tur-moil
	Prayer keeps the heart at rest, and nerves for toil.
---
5. Pray, always pray; if joys thy pathway throng.
	Pray'r strikes the harp and sings the angels' song.

6. Pray, always pray, if loved one pass the veil.
	Pray'r drinks with them of springs that cannot fail
---
7. All earthly things with earth shall fade away,
	Pray'r grasps eternity, pray, always pray.

Amen.
