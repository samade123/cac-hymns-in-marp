## This is the day the Lord hath made
### (CM - s.f.m: rd. sls. f.m:-m.rd. lsf:- mr:- )

1. This is the day the Lord hath made,
    He calls the hours His own;
    Let Heav'n rejoice, let earth be glad,
    And praise surround His Throne.

2. Today He rose and left the dead.
    And Satan's empire fell;
    Today the saints His triumphs spread,
    And all His wonders tell

---

3. Hosanna to the anointed King,
    To David's Holy Son!
    Help us, O Lord! descend and bring
    Salvation from Thy Throne.

4. Bless'd be the Lord, who comes to men
    With messages of grace;
    Who comes, in God His Father's Name
    To save our sinful race.

---

5. Hosanna in the highest strains
    The Church on earth can raise;
    The highest Heav'ns, in which He reigns,
    Shall give Him nobler praise.

Amen.
