# CACGHB 581
##  Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing,

1. Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing,
	Fill our hearts with joy and peace;
	Let us each, Thy love possessing,
	Triumph in redeeming grace;
	Oh refresh us, oh refresh us,
	Traveling through this wilderness.

---

2. Thanks we give, and adoration,
	For Thy Gospel's joyful sound;
	May the fruits of Thy salvation
	In our hearts and lives abound;
	May Thy presence, may Thy presence
	With us evermore be found.

---

3. So, whene'er the signal's given,
	Us from earth to call away,
	Borne on angels' wings to heaven,
	Glad the summons to obey,
	May we ever, may we ever
	Reign with Christ in endless day.

Amen.
