# CACGHB 334 - Christ the Lord is risen to-day

1. Christ the Lord is risen to-day
	Hallelujah!
	Sons of men, and, angels, say,
	Hallelujah!
	Raise your joys and triumphs high; Hallelujah!
	Sing, ye heav'ns; thou earth, reply, Hallelujah

---

2. Love's redeeming work is done; Hallelujah !
	Fought the fight, the battle won;
	Hallelujah!
	Lo! Our sun's eclipse is o'er,
	Hallelujah!
	Lo! He sets in blood no more,
	Hallelujah!

---

3. Vain the stone, the watch, the seal; Hallelujah
	Christ hath burst the gates of hell; Hallelujah!
	Death in vain forbids His rise!
	Hallelujah!
	Christ hath open'd paradise.
	Hallelujah!

---

4. Lives again our glorious King;
	Hallelujah
	Where, O death, is now thy sting? Hallelujah!
	Once He died our souls to save.
	Hallelujah!
	Where thy victory, O grave?
	Hallelujah!

---

5. Soar we now where Christ hath led Hallelujah.!
	Following our exalted Head:
	Hallelujah!
	Made like Him, like Him we rise,
	Hallelujah!
	Ours-the cross, the grave the skies, Hallelujah!

---

6. Hail the Lord of earth and heaven, Hallelujah!
	Praise to Thee by both be given;
	Hallelujah!
	Thee we greet triumphant now,
	Hallelujah!
	Hail the Resurrection Thou!
	Hallelujah!

Amen.
