# CACGHB 095 - Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation

1. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation,
   O my soul, praise Him for He is thy health and salvation;
   All ye who hear,
   Brothers and sisters draw near,
   Praise Him in glad adoration.

2. Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,
   Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so
   Gently sustaineth;
   Hast thou not seen?
   All that is needful hath been;
   Granted in what he ordaineth.

3. Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper
   Thy work and defend thee;
   Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee;
   Ponder anew
   What the Almighty can do,
   If with His love he befriend thee.

4. Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore Him!
   All that hath life and breath, come
   now with praises before Him!
   Let the Amen
   Sound from His people again:
   Gladly for aye we adore him.

Amen.
