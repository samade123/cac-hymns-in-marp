# CACGHB 184 - O Lord our God, stretch out Thy hand

1. O Lord our God, stretch out Thy hand
    Let us Thy glory see
    That all of us may see Thy sign
    To melt the heart of stone.

2. In Thy mercy, forgive our sins,
    Deliver us from guilt
    That the new year we have started
    May come to end with Thee.

---

3. Send Thy Holy Ghost from above
    That we may love Thee most
    That the sinner who has no love
    May learn to love others.

4. And when we come before Thee, Lord
    In our eternal home
    That many may join with us here
    To give our praise to Thee.

Amen.
