# CACGHB 756

## Sing the wondrous love of Jesus.

1. Sing the wondrous love of Jesus.
   Sing His mercy and His grace,
   In the mansions bright and blessed,
   He' ll prepare for us a place.

Chorus:
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be?
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

---

2. While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
   Clouds will over spread the sky;
   But when travelling days are over,
   Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Chorus:
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be?
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

---

3. Let us then be true and faithful,
   Trusting, serving every day;
   Just one glimpse of His in glory
   will the toils of life repay.

Chorus:
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be?
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

---

4. Onward to the prize before us!
   Soon His beauty we'll behold;
   Soon the pearly gates will open,
   We shall tread the street of gold.


Chorus:
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be?
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

Amen.
