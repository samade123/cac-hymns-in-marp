# CACGHB 115

## Our Father and our God

1. Our Father and our God,
   Accept our songs of praise
   On earth and heav'n above,
   The God who reigns in love,
   To Thee is due all praise and thanks
   And majesty for ever more.

2. External Son of God
   Who shed His blood for us,
   Who rose up from the dead
   And up to heav'n ascend
   To Thee is due all praise and thanks
   And majesty for ever more.

3. To Thee the Holy Ghost,
   We raise our songs of praise
   Thou who has shed the light
   Of life into our hearts,
   To Thee is due all praise and thanks
   And majesty for ever more.

4. Our Holy Triune God
   We praise the Three-in-One
   On earth and heav'n above,
   We raise our songs of praise
   To Thee is due all praise and thanks
   And majesty for ever more.

Amen.
