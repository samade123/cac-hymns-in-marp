# CACGHB 825 - Christ, our mighty Captain, leads against the foe
## FORWARD 11.11.11.7. & Ref Speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward. - Exd.14:15

1. Christ, our mighty Captain, leads against the foe
	We will never falter, when he bids us go;
	Tho' His righteous purpose we may never know,
	Yet we'll follow all the way.

Chorus:
	Forward! Forward! 'tis the
	Lords command,
	Forward! forward to the
	promise land;
	Forward! Forward! Let the
	chorus ring
	We are sure to win with Christ
	our king.

2. Satan's fearful onslaughts cannot make us yield
	While we trust in Christ, our
	Buckler and our shield
	Pressing ever on the spirit's sword we wield,
	And we follow all the way.

Chorus:
	Forward! Forward! 'tis the
	Lords command,
	Forward! forward to the
	promise land;
	Forward! Forward! Let the
	chorus ring
	We are sure to win with Christ
	our king.

3. Let our glorious banner ever be unfurled
	From its mighty stronghold evil shall be hurled;
	Christ, our mighty Captain, over comes the world,
	And we follow all the way.

Chorus:
	Forward! Forward! 'tis the
	Lords command,
	Forward! forward to the
	promise land;
	Forward! Forward! Let the
	chorus ring
	We are sure to win with Christ
	our king.

---

4. Fierce the battle rages, but 'twill not be long,
	Then triumphant shall we join the blessed throng,
	Joyfully uniting in the victor's song
	If we follow all the way.

Chorus:
	Forward! Forward! 'tis the
	Lords command,
	Forward! forward to the
	promise land;
	Forward! Forward! Let the
	chorus ring
	We are sure to win with Christ
	our king.

Amen.
