# CACGHB 022 - Abide with me fast falls the eventide

<style scoped>

   section {
        font-size: 2em;
    }
</style>

1. Abide with me fast falls the eventide;
   The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide!
   When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
   Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

2. Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day
    Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away
    Change and decay in all around I see
    O thou who changest not, abide with me!

---

3. Come not in terrors, as the King of kings,
    But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings
    Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea.
    Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.

4. I need Thy presence every passing hour;
    What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
    Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
    Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.

---

5. I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
    Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;
    Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?
    I triumph still, if thou abide with me.

6. Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes
    Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
    Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee:
    In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!

Amen.
