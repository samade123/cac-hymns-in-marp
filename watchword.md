# Watchword 2024:

And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.

## (Isaiah 58:11)

---

You shall increase my greatness,
And comfort me on every side.

## (Psalm 71:21)

I know the plans that I have for you, declares Yahweh. They are plans for peace and not disaster, plans to give you a future filled with hope.

## (Jeremiah 29:11)

---

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
me, all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord, forever.

---

May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit abide with us now and forevermore,
Amen.
