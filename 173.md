# CACGHB 173 - My Times Are in Thy Hand


1. My times are in Thy hand,  
My God, I wish them there;  
My life, my friends, my soul I leave  
Entirely to Thy care.  

2. My times are in Thy hand  
Whatever they may be,  
Pleasing or painful, dark or bright,  
As best may seem to Thee.  

---

3. My times are in Thy hand,  
Why should I doubt or fear?  
A Father's hand will never cause  
His child a needless tear.  

4. My times are in Thy hand,  
Jesus the crucified;  
The hand my cruel sins had pierced  
Is now my guard and guide.  

---

5. My times are in Thy hand;  
I'll always trust in Thee,  
And after death at Thy right hand  
I shall for ever be.  

**Amen.**
