## Saviour, like a shepherd lead us,

1. Saviour, like a shepherd lead us,
	Much we need Thy tender care;
	In Thy pleasant pastures feed us,
	For our use Thy folds prepare;
	Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
	Thou hast bought us, Thine we are;
	Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
	Thou hast bought us, Thine we are.

2. We are Thine; do Thou be friend us,
	Be the Guardian of our way;
	Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us,
	Seek us when we go astray:
	Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
	Hear Thy children when they pray
	Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
	Hear Thy children when they pray.

3. Thou hast promised to receive us,
	Poor and sinful though we be;
	Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
	Grace to cleanse, and make us free:
	Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
	Early let us turn to Thee.
	Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
	Early let us turn to Thee.

4. Early let us seek Thy favour;
	Early let us do Thy will;
	Blessed Lord and only Saviour,
	With Thy love our bosoms fill;
	Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
	Thou hast loved us, love us still.
	Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
	Thou hast loved us, love us still.

Amen.
