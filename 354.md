# CACGHB 354 - Come, ye that love the Lord,


1. Come, ye that love the Lord,
	Who know His great might, come,
	In oneness and in sweet
	Fellowship, praise His love,
	To heaven and earth, proclaim the name
	Of your might Redeemer, Lord.

--- 

2. He left His throne on high
	And left His glory too
	He came down here in love,
	He wept , He bled and died,
	The pain He bore, who may declare,
	To save us from eternal death.

 

3. He burst the grave and rose
	Triumphant over death;
	He taught His vanquished foes
	How they may intercede
	He went in truimp through the heaven's
	In vict'ry to the throne of God.

--- 

4. He will soon come again
	His chariots tarry not
	To take His son and go
	To land of endless day;
	There we shall see Him face to face
	And sing the triumph of His grace.



5. Jesus we cannot pay
	The debt of love we owe
	Teach us the way to pay
	Accept our praise and thanks
	Our soul and body to Thee giv'n
	Accept though little it may be.

Amen.
