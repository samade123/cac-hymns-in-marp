# CACGHB 670

## When this passing world is done

1. When this passing world is done,
	When has sunk yon glaring sun,
	When we stand with Christ on high,
	Looking o'er life's history,
	Then, Lord, shall I fully know,-
	Not till then, -how much I owe.

---    

2. When I stand before the throne,
	Dress'd in beauty not my own,
	When I see Thee as Thou art,
	Love Thee with unsinning heart;
	Then, Lord, shall I fully know,-
	di Not till then, -how much I owe.

---    

3. When the praise of heav'n I hear,
	Loud as thunders to the ear,
	Loud as many water's noise,
	Sweet as harp's melodious voice;
	Then, Lord, shall I fully know,-
	di Not till then, -how much I owe.

---    

4. Ev'n on earth, as though a glass,
	Darkly, let Thy glory pass;
	Make forgiveness feel so sweet,
	Make Thy Spirit's help so meet;
	Ev'n on earth, Lord, make me know
	Something of how much I owe.

---    

5. Chosen not for good in me,
	Waken'd up from wrath to flee,
	Hidden in the Saviour's side,
	By the Spirit sanctified.
	Teach me, Lord, on earth to show,
	By my love, how much I owe.

Amen.
