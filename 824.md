# CACGHB 824
##   The God who led His people thro' the parted sea,

1. The God who led His people thro' the parted sea,
	And from Egyptian bondage set
	His children free,
	Who rain'd down from heaven all the pilgrim way
	Is the God to whom I pray

Just the same today, just the same today,
As when He led His people thro 'the sea,
His trustful child I'll be, For in
His word I see,
The God who doeth wonders,
Is just the same today.

2. The God who rescued Daniel from the lion's den
	And from the fiery furnace sav'd the three young men
	Who speaks, and constellations will His voice obey
	Is the God to whom I pray.


Just the same today, just the same today,
As when He led His people thro 'the sea,
His trustful child I'll be, For in
His word I see,
The God who doeth wonders,
Is just the same today.

3. The God who stills the tempest with a word divine,
	And on the clouds of sorrow, makes His rainbows shine,
	Who from the tomb of Jesus rolled the stone away
	Is the God to whom I pray.


Just the same today, just the same today,
As when He led His people thro 'the sea,
His trustful child I'll be, For in
His word I see,
The God who doeth wonders,
Is just the same today.

4. The God who clothes the lily in its robe of snow
	Who in the barren desert makes
	His rivers flow,
	The God who lifts the sinner from the miry clay
	Is the God to whom I pray.

Just the same today, just the same today,
As when He led His people thro 'the sea,
His trustful child I'll be, For in
His word I see,
The God who doeth wonders,
Is just the same today.

Amen.
