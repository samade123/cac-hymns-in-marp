# CACGHB 874
##   I have found a Friend in Jesus,



1. I have found a Friend in Jesus,
	He's the everything to me,
	He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
	The lily of the valley, in Him alone I see
	And I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.
	In sorrow He's my comfort in trouble He's my stay,
	He tells me every care on
	Him to roll:
	He's the lily of the valley,
	The Bright and Morning star,
	He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul

Chorus:
	In sorrow he's my comfort,
	In trouble He my stay
	He tells me every care on him to roll:
	He's the lily of the valley,
	The Bright and Morning star
	He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

2. He all my griefs has taken, and all my sorrows borne;
	In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower;
	I have all for him forsaken, and all my I dols torns
	From my heart,and now He keeps me by His power.
	Though all the world forsake me,
	And satan tempt me sore.
	Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal:
	He's the lily of the valley, the
	Bright and Morning star,
	He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

Chorus:
	In sorrow he's my comfort,
	In trouble He my stay
	He tells me every care on him to roll:
	He's the lily of the valley,
	The Bright and Morning star
	He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

3. He will never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here
	While I live by faith and do His blessed will;
	A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear
	With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.
	Then sweeping up to glory, to see his blessed face
	Where rivers of delight shall ever roll:
	He's the lily of the valley, the
	Bright and Morning star,
	He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul

Chorus:
	In sorrow he's my comfort,
	In trouble He my stay
	He tells me every care on him to roll:
	He's the lily of the valley,
	The Bright and Morning star
	He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

Amen.
