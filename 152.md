# CACGHB 152 - Joy to the world! The Lord is come

1. Joy to the world! The Lord is come;
    Let earth receive her King;
    Let every heart prepare Him room,
    And heaven and nature sing, (2ce)
    And heav'n, and heav'n and nature sing.

2. Joy to the earth! The Saviour reigns;
    Let men their songs employ;
    While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
    Repeat the sounding joy, (2ce)
    Repeat, repeat the sounding joy,

---

3. No more let sins and sorrows grow,
    Nor thorns infest the ground;
    He comes to make His blessings flow
    Far as the curse is found, (2ce)
    Far as, far as the curse is found.

4. He rules the world with truth and grace,
    And makes the nations prove
    The glories of His righteousness
    And wonders of His love (2ce)
    And wonders, and wonders of His love.

Amen.
