# CACGHB 179 - Almighty, Thou God of our peace

1. Almighty, Thou God of our peace
    Decreed that the year roll by:
    The children have come to thank Thee
    For the new year just begun,
    Praise ye the Lord, Praise ye the Lord,
    The great king who spared our lives.

2. We thank Thee for our protection
    In the year that has just passed,
    We implore Thee for Thy help, Lord
    For us all in this new year,
    Let Thy flock here, Praise ye the Lord,
    Keep growing in Jesus Christ.

3. May the adults prepare themselves
    To serve with one heart this year,
    May the young ones too be ready
    To seek God with all their hearts.
    May the Lord's peace, Praise ye the Lord,
    Be the crown of this new year.

4. May the Holy Ghost from on high
    Come upon us, this new year;
    May the pastor and the teacher
    And all the congregation,
    Prepare themselves, Praise ye the Lord,
    To do service for the Lord.

Amen
