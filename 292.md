# CACGHB 292 - Redemption! Oh, wonderful story

1. Redemption! Oh, wonderful story
    Glad message for you and for me
    That Jesus has purchased our pardon,
    And paid all the debt on the tree.

Chorus:
	Believe it, O sinner, believe it,
	Receive the glad message-'tis true;
	Trust now in the crucified Saviour
	Salvation he offers to you.

---

2. From death unto life He hath brought us
    And made us by grace Sons of God;
    A fountain is opened for sinners;
    Oh, wash and be cleans'd in the blood.

Chorus:
	Believe it, O sinner, believe it,
	Receive the glad message-'tis true;
	Trust now in the crucified Saviour
	Salvation he offers to you.

---

3. No longer shall sin have dominion,
    Though present to tempt and annoy;
    For Christ , in His blessed redemption,
    The power of sin shall destroy.

Chorus:
	Believe it, O sinner, believe it,
	Receive the glad message-'tis true;
	Trust now in the crucified Saviour
	Salvation he offers to you.

---

4. Accept now God's offer of mercy;
    To Jesus, oh, hasten today;
    For He will received him that cometh,
    And never will turn him away.

    Chorus:
	Believe it, O sinner, believe it,
	Receive the glad message-'tis true;
	Trust now in the crucified Saviour
	Salvation he offers to you.

Amen.
