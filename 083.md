# CACGHB 083

## LYRIC 8.8.6 
## I will speak of the glorious honour of Thy majesty, and of Thy wondrous work. - Ps. 145:5

1. To Thee, O Comforter divine
    For all Thy grace and pow'r benign
    Sing we Alleluia!

---

2. To Thee, whose faithful love had place
    In God's great covenant of grace
    Sing we Alleluia!


3. To Thee, whose faithful pow'r doth heal
    Enlighten, sanctify and seal
    Sing we Alleluia!

---

4. To Thee, our teacher and our friend
    Our faithful leader to the end
    Sing we Alleluia!


5. To Thee, by Jesus Christ sent down
    Of all his gifts the sun and crown
    Sing we Alleluia!

Amen
