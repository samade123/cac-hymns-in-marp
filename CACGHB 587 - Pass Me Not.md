# CACGHB 587 - Pass Me Not

## 8.5.8.5. & Ref Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered. - Joel 2:32


1. Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,  
Hear my humble cry;  
While on others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by.

Chorus:
Saviour! Saviour! Hear my humble cry.  
And while others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by.

---

2.Let me at a throne of mercy  
Find a sweet relief;  
Kneeling there in deep contrition,  
Help my unbelief.

Chorus:
Saviour! Saviour! Hear my humble cry.  
And while others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by.

---

3. Trusting only in Thy merit  
Would I seek Thy face;  
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,  
Same me by Thy grace.

Chorus:
Saviour! Saviour! Hear my humble cry.  
And while others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by.

---

4. Thou the spring of all my comfort,  
More than life to me,  
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?  
Whom in heaven but Thee?

Chorus:
Saviour! Saviour! Hear my humble cry.  
And while others Thou art calling,  
Do not pass me by.

**Amen.**
