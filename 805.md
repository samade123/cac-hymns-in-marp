# CACGHB 805
##  My trust I place now and ever

1. My trust I place now and ever
	In one my soul can deliver
	A refuge strong failing never,
	For His Word is sure.

Chorus:
	I am Alpha and Omega
	The beginning and the ending
	Which is and which was,
	And which is to come
	I am Alpha and Omega
	The beginning and the ending
	The Almighty,
	The Almighty,
	Saith the Lord.

2. My heart with joy now is telling
	Of Him who finds there a dwelling,
	Whose love is gently compelling,
	On His Word to rest.


Chorus:
	I am Alpha and Omega
	The beginning and the ending
	Which is and which was,
	And which is to come
	I am Alpha and Omega
	The beginning and the ending
	The Almighty,
	The Almighty,
	Saith the Lord.

3. Jehovah, God! Still attend me,
	From doubt and fear still defend me
	Faith to sustain ever send me,
	That my soul fail not.


Chorus:
	I am Alpha and Omega
	The beginning and the ending
	Which is and which was,
	And which is to come
	I am Alpha and Omega
	The beginning and the ending
	The Almighty,
	The Almighty,
	Saith the Lord.

Amen.
