# CACGHB 077 - All hail the power of Jesus' name


1. All hail the power of Jesus' name,
    Let angels prostrate fall;
    Bring forth the royal diadem
    To crown Him Lord of all.
    
---

2. Crown Him, ye martyrs of our God,
    Who from His altar call;
    Extol Him in whose path ye trod,
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    

3. Ye seed of Israel's chosen race,
    Ye ransomed from the fall,
    Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
    And crown Him Lord of all.

4. Sinners! whose love can ne'er forget
    The wormwood and the gall;
    Go spread your trophies at His feet,
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    

5. Let every kindred, every tribe,
    On this terrestrial ball,
    To Him all majesty ascribe,
    And crown Him Lord of all.
    
---    

6. O that with yonder sacred throng
    We at His feet may fall,
    Join in the everlasting song,
    And crown Him Lord of all!

Amen.
