# CACGHB 355 - See the conqueror mounts in triumph


1. See the conqueror mounts in triumph,
	See the king in royal state,
	Riding on the cloud His chariot,
	To the heavenly palace gate;
	Hark, the choirs of angel voices
	Joyful Hallelujahs sing,
	And the portals high are lifted,
	To receive, their heav'nly king.

2. Who is this that comes in glory,
	With the trumph of jubilee?
	Lord of battles, God of armies,
	He has gain'd the victory;
	He who on the cross did suffer,
	He who from the grave arose,
	He has vanquish'd sin and satan,
	He by death has spoil'd His foes.

3. While He raised His hands in blessing,
	He was parted from His friends,
	While their eager eyes behold Him,
	He upon the clouds ascends;
	He who walk'd with God and pleased Him,
	Preaching truth and doom to come,
	He, our Enoch, is translate
	To His everlasting home.

4. Now our heav'nly Aaron enters,
	With His blood within the veil;
	Joshua now is come to Canaan,
	And the kings before Him quail:
	mf Now He plants the tribes of Israel
	In their promised resting-place;
	Now our great Elijah offers
	Double portion of His grace.

5. Thou hast raised our human nature
	In the clouds to God's right hand,
	There we sit in heav'nly places,
	There with Thee in glory stand;
	Jesus reigns adored by angels;
	Man with God is on the throne;
	Mighty Lord in Thine ascension,
	We by faith behold our own.

Amen.
