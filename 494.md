# CACGHB 494

## What can wash away my sin?

1. What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

    Chorus:
    Oh precious is the flow
    That makes me white as snow!
    No other fount I know;
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus!


2. For my cleansing this I see-
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
For my pardon this my plea-
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

    Chorus:
    Oh precious is the flow
    That makes me white as snow!
    No other fount I know;
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

3. Nothing can for sin atone-
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
Nought of good that I have done-
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

    Chorus:
    Oh precious is the flow
    That makes me white as snow!
    No other fount I know;
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus!


4. This is all my hope and peace-
Nothing but the blood of Jesu!
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!


    Chorus:
    Oh precious is the flow
    That makes me white as snow!
    No other fount I know;
    Nothing but the blood of Jesus!


Amen.
