# CACGHB 815

1. Conquerors and over comers now are we,
	Thro' the precious blood of Christ we've victory
	If the Lord be for us we can never fail,
	Nothing 'gainst His mighty power can e'er prevail


Conquerors are we, thro' the blood of Jesus
God will give us victory, thro' the blood of Jesus
Through the lamb for sinners slain,
Yet who lives and reign again,
More than conquerors are we,
More than conquerors are we,

---

2. In the name of Israel's God we'll onward press
	Overcoming sin and all unrighteousness;
	Not to us but unto Him the praise shall be,
	For salvation and for blood bought victory.

Conquerors are we, thro' the blood of Jesus
God will give us victory, thro' the blood of Jesus
Through the lamb for sinners slain,
Yet who lives and reign again,
More than conquerors are we,
More than conquerors are we,

---

3. Unto Him that overcometh shall be given,
	Here to eat of hidden manna sent from Heaven,
	Over yonder He the victors palm shall bear,
	And a robe of white, and golden crown shall wear.

Conquerors are we, thro' the blood of Jesus
God will give us victory, thro' the blood of Jesus
Through the lamb for sinners slain,
Yet who lives and reign again,
More than conquerors are we,
More than conquerors are we,

Amen.
