## HEREFORD D.C.M
## AWAKE PSALTERY AND HARP I MYSELF WILL AWAKE EARLY. PS.108:2

1. Awake, glad soul! Awake, awake!
	Thy, Lord hath risen long;
	Go to His grave, and with thee take
	Both tuneful heart and song;
	Where life is waking all around
	Where love's sweet voices sing
	The first bright blossom may be, found
	Of an eternal spring.

---

2. The shade and gloom of life are fled
	This resurrection day;
	Henceforth in Christ are no more dead,
	The grave hath no more prey;
	In Christ we live, in Christ we sleep,
	In Christ we wake and rise,
	And the sad tears death makes us weep
	He wipes from all our eyes

---

3. And every bird and every tree,
	And every op'ning flower,
	Proclaim His resurrection take
	His resurrection pow'r,
	The folds are glad, the fields rejoice
	With vernal verdure spread
	The little hills lift up their voice
	And shout that death is dead..

---

4. Then wake, glad heart! Awake, awake,
	And seek thy risen Lord,
	Joy in His resurrection take
	And comfort in His word:
	And let thy life through all its ways,
	One long thanksgiving be,
	Its theme of joy, its song of me"
	"Christ died and rose for me"

Amen.
