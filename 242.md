# CACGHB 242 - I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,

1. I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
    And it told Thy love to me;
    But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
    And be closer drawn to Thee.

    Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord.
    To the Cross where Thou hast died;
    Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
    To Thy precious, bleeding side,

---

2. Consecrate me now to Thy service Lord,
    By the pow'r of grace divine;
    Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
    And my will be lost in Thine

 Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord.
    To the Cross where Thou hast died;
    Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
    To Thy precious, bleeding side,

---

3. O the pure delight of a single hour
    That before Thy throne I spend,
    When I kneel in pray'r and with Thee,my God.
    I commune as friend with friend.

 Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord.
    To the Cross where Thou hast died;
    Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
    To Thy precious, bleeding side,

---

4. There are depths of love that I cannot know
    Till I cross the narrow sea;
    There are heights of joy that I may not reach
    Till I rest in peace with Thee

 Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord.
    To the Cross where Thou hast died;
    Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
    To Thy precious, bleeding side,

Amen
