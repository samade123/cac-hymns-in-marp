## ICH HALTE TREULIC STILL
### D.S.M And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. - Act.2:4

1. Lord God the Holy Ghost,
	In this accepted hour,
	As on the day of Pentecost,
	Descend in all Thy pow'r
	We meet with one accord
	In our appointed place,
	And wait the promise of our Lord,
	The Spirit of all grace.


2. Like mighty rushing wind
	Upon the waves beneath,
	Move with one impulse every mind,
	One soul, one feeling, breathe:
	The young, the old, inspire
	With wisdom from above;
	And give us hearts and tongues of fire
	To pray, and praise, and love.

3. Spirit of light, explore
	And chase our gloom away,
	With lustre shining more and more
	Unto the perfect day;
	Spirit of truth, be Thou
	In life and death our Guide,
	O spirit of adoption, now
	May we be sanctified.

Amen.
