# CACGHB 819
##   Begone, unbelief, My Saviour is near,
<!-- --- -->

1. Begone, unbelief,
	My Saviour is near,
	And for my relief
	Will surely appear:
	By pray'r let me wrestle,
	And He will perform;
	With Christ in the vessels,
	I smile at the storm.

2. Though dark be my way.
	Since he is my Guide,
	'Tis mine to obey,
	'Tis His to provide;
	Though cisterns be broken,
	And creatures all fail,
	The word He hath spoken
	Shall surely prevail.

---

3. His love, in time past
	Forbids me to think
	He'll leave me at last
	In trouble to sink:
	Each sweet Ebenezer
	I have in review
	Confirms His good pleasure
	To help me quit through.


4. Why should I complain
	Of want or distress,
	Temptation or pain?
	He told me no less;
	The heirs of salvation,
	I know from His Word
	Through much tribulation
	Must follow their lord.

---

5. How bitter that cup
	No heart can conceive,
	Which He drank quit up,
	That sinners might live!
	His way was much rougher
	And darker than mine;
	Did Christ, my lord, suffer,
	And shall I repine?

6. Since all that I meet
	Shall work for my good,
	The bitter is sweet,
	The medicine, food,
	Though painful at long present
	'Twill cease before long,
	ff And then-oh, how pleasant
	The conqueror's song!

Amen.
