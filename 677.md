# CACGHB 677
##  Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,

1. Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
	Pilgrim through this barren land
	I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
	Hold me with Thy pow'rful hand;
	Bread of heaven! Bread of heaven!
	Feed me now and evermore.

---

2. Open Thou the crystal fountain,
	Whence the healing stream shall flow
	Let the fiery, cloudy pillar
	Lead me all my journey through:
	Strong Deliverer! Strong Deliverer!
	Be Thou still my help and shield.


3. When I tread the verge of Jordan,
	Bid my anxious fears subside;
	Death of deaths, and hell's destruction
	Land me safe on Canaan's side:
	Song of praises Song of praises
	I will ever give to Thee.

Amen.
