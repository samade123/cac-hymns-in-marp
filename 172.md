# CACGHB 172 - A few more years shall roll

1. A few more years shall roll,
   A few more seasons come,
   And we shall be with those that rest
   Asleep within the tomb.

   Chorus:
   Then, O my Lord, prepare
   My soul for that great day;
   O wash me in Thy precious blood,
   And take my sins away.

2. A few more suns shall set
   O'er these dark hills of time,
   And we shall be where suns are not
   A far serener clime.

   Chorus:
   Then, O my Lord, prepare
   My soul for that great day;
   O wash me in Thy precious blood,
   And take my sins away.

3. A few more storms shall beat
   On this wild rocky shore,
   And we shall be where tempests cease
   And surges swell no more.

   Chorus:
   Then, O my Lord, prepare
   My soul for that great day;
   O wash me in Thy precious blood,
   And take my sins away.

4. A few more struggles here,
   A few more partings o'er
   A few more toils, a few more tears,
   And we shall weep no more.

   Chorus:
   Then, O my Lord, prepare
   My soul for that great day;
   O wash me in Thy precious blood,
   And take my sins away.

5. A few more Sabbaths here
   Shall cheer us on our way,
   And we shall reach the endless rest,
   The eternal Sabbath day.

   Chorus:
   Then, O my Lord, prepare
   My soul for that great day;
   O wash me in Thy precious blood,
   And take my sins away.

6. 'Tis but a little while
   And He shall come again
   Who died that we might live, who lives
   That we with Him may reign.

   Chorus:
   Then, O my Lord, prepare
   My soul for that great day;
   O wash me in Thy precious blood,
   And take my sins away.

Amen.
