# The First Noel


1. The First Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

    Chorus:

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
    Born is the King of Israel.


2. They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

    Chorus:

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
    Born is the King of Israel.

3. And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

    Chorus:

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
    Born is the King of Israel.

4. This star drew nigh to the northwest,
Oâ€™er Bethlehem it took it rest,
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

    Chorus:

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
    Born is the King of Israel.

5. Then entered in those Wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

    Chorus:

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
    Born is the King of Israel.

6. Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind has bought.

    Chorus:

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
    Born is the King of Israel.
