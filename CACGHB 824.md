> For I am the Lord, I change not. - Mal.3:6

## Verse 1

1. The God who led His people thro' the parted sea,  
   And from Egyptian bondage set His children free,  
   Who rain'd down from heaven all the pilgrim way  
   Is the God to whom I pray.

   **Chorus:**  
   Just the same today, just the same today,  
   As when He led His people thro 'the sea,  
   His trustful child I'll be, for in His word I see,  
   The God who doeth wonders,  
   Is just the same today.

## Verse 2

2. The God who rescued Daniel from the lion's den  
   And from the fiery furnace sav'd the three young men,  
   Who speaks, and constellations will His voice obey  
   Is the God to whom I pray.

   **Chorus:**  
   Just the same today, just the same today,  
   As when He led His people thro 'the sea,  
   His trustful child I'll be, for in His word I see,  
   The God who doeth wonders,  
   Is just the same today.

## Verse 3

3. The God who stills the tempest with a word divine,  
   And on the clouds of sorrow, makes His rainbows shine,  
   Who from the tomb of Jesus rolled the stone away  
   Is the God to whom I pray.

   **Chorus:**  
   Just the same today, just the same today,  
   As when He led His people thro 'the sea,  
   His trustful child I'll be, for in His word I see,  
   The God who doeth wonders,  
   Is just the same today.

## Verse 4

4. The God who clothes the lily in its robe of snow  
   Who in the barren desert makes His rivers flow,  
   The God who lifts the sinner from the miry clay  
   Is the God to whom I pray.

   **Chorus:**  
   Just the same today, just the same today,  
   As when He led His people thro 'the sea,  
   His trustful child I'll be, for in His word I see,  
   The God who doeth wonders,  
   Is just the same today.

Amen.
