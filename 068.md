## Praise the King of Glory


1. Praise the King of Glory, He is God alone:
    Praise Him for the wonders, He to us hath shown;
    For His promised presence, All the pilgrim way,
    For the flaming pillar, And the cloud by day.

Chorus:
    Praise …Him, shining angels,
    Strike …Your harps of gold,
    All ….His hosts adore Him,
    Who….His face behold;
    Through …His great dominion.
    While …the ages roll
    All His works shall praise Him
    All His works shall praise Him
    Bless the Lord, my soul!.

2. Praise Him for redemption, free to every soul;
    Praise Him for the Fountain that can make us whole;
    For His gifts of Kindness and His loving care,
    For the blest assurance that He answers prayer.

Chorus:
    Praise …Him, shining angels,
    Strike …Your harps of gold,
    All ….His hosts adore Him,
    Who….His face behold;
    Through …His great dominion.
    While …the ages roll
    All His works shall praise Him
    All His works shall praise Him
    Bless the Lord, my soul!.

3. Praise Him for the trials sent as cords of love
    Binding us more closely to the things above;
    For the faith that conquers, hope that naught can dim,
    For the land where loved ones gather unto Him.

Chorus:
    Praise …Him, shining angels,
    Strike …Your harps of gold,
    All ….His hosts adore Him,
    Who….His face behold;
    Through …His great dominion.
    While …the ages roll
    All His works shall praise Him
    All His works shall praise Him
    Bless the Lord, my soul!.

Amen.
