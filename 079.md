# CACGHB 079 -  Praise my soul the King of Heaven

1. Praise my soul the King of Heaven
    To His feet thy tribute bring,
    Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
    Who like Thee His praise should sing
    Praise Him! Praise Him!
    Praise the everlasting King!

2. Praise Him for His grace and favour
    To Our father in distress;
    Praise Him still the same for ever,
    Slow to chide and swift to bless:
    Praise Him! Praise Him!
    Glorious in His faithfulness

3. Father-like He tends and spares us;
    Well our feeble frame he knows,
    In His hands He gently bears us,
    Rescues us from all our foes;
    Praise Him! Praise Him!
    Widely as His mercy flows

4. We, like flow'rs its petals bringing!
    Blown by wind, withered away,
    While on earth or with Thee above,
    Our Lord God remain unchanged!
    Praise Him! Praise Him!
    Praise the everlasting King

---

5. Angels, help us to adore Him
    Ye behold Him face to face!
    Sun and Moon bow down before Him!
    Dwellers all in time and space
    Praise Him! Praise Him!
    Praise with us the God of grace!
 
Amen.
