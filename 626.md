## HYD Y NOS 
### 8.4.8.4.8.8.8.4. It is well with thee. It is well. - II Kings 4:26

1. Through the love of God our Saviour,
	All will be well;
	Free and changeless is His favour,
	All, all is well:
	Precious is the blood that heal'd us;
	Perfect is the grace that seal'd us;
	Strong the hand strech'd forth to shield us,
	All must be well.


2. Thou we pass through tribulation,
	All will be well;
	Christ hath purchas'd full salvation,
	All, all is well;
	Happy still in God confiding;
	Fruitful, if in Christ abiding;
	Holy, through the Spirit's guiding,
	All must be well.

3. We expect a bright tomorrow;
	All, will be well;
	Faith can sing through days of sorrow
	All, all is well;
	On our Father's love relying,
	Jesus every need supplying,
	Then in living or in dying
	All must be well.

Amen.
