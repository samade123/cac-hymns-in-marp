# CACGHB 882
##  Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,

1. 'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
	Just to take Him at His word:
	Just to rest upon His promise:
	Just to know, ''Thus saith the Lord.

	Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
	How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
	Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
	O for grace to trust Him more!

---

2. O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
	Just to trust His cleansing blood;
	Just in simple faith to plunge me
	'Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

	Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
	How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
	Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
	O for grace to trust Him more!

---

3. Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
	Just from sin and self to cease;
	Just from Jesus simply taking
	Life and rest, and joy and peace.

	Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
	How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
	Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
	O for grace to trust Him more!

---

4. I'm so glad I learn'd to trust Thee
	Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;
	And I know that Thou art with me,
	Wilt be with me to the end.

	Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
	How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
	Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
	O for grace to trust Him more!


Amen.
