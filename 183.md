# CACGHB 183 - O Lord, God of our salvation

1. O Lord, God of our salvation
    Our guide, our leader and our might
    Has brought us together tonight,
    Let us lift our Ebenezer,
    The old year that we have gone through
    Has the Lord crowned with His goodness,
    Each morning new is Thy mercy,
    Let our appreciation increase.

2. Jesus who sits upon the Throne
    We raise Hallelujah to Thee
    Because of Thee and Thee alone
    We have been spared to come and sing;
    Help us to have contrition for
    The many sins of the past year,
    Help us to use this coming year
    To praise Thee more than year gone by.

Amen.
