# CACGHB 151 - Hark! The herald-angels sing

1. Hark! The herald-angels sing
    Glory to the new-born King,
    Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
    God and sinners reconciled,
    Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
    Join the triumph of the skies,
    With the angelic host proclaim,
    Christ is born in Bethlehem.
    
    Chorus: 
    Hark! The herald-angels sing
    Glory to the new-born King.


2. Christ, by highest heav'n ador'd,
    Christ, the everlasting Lord
    Late in time behold Him come,
    Offspring of a virgin's womb!
    Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
    Hail the incarnate Deity!
    Pleas'd as Man with man to dwell,
    Jesus, our Immanuel.
    
    Chorus: 
    Hark! The herald-angels sing
    Glory to the new-born King.

3. Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!
    Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
    Light and life to all He brings,
    Risen with healing in His wings,
    Mild He lays His glory by,
    Born that man no more may die,
    Born to raise the sons of earth,
    Born to give them second birth.

    Chorus: 
    Hark! The herald-angels sing
    Glory to the new-born King.


4. Come, Desire of nations, come,
    Fix in us Thy humble home,
    Rise, the woman's conquering Seed,
    Bruise in us the serpent's head.
    Adam's likeness now efface,
    Stamp Thine image in its place,
    Second Adam from above,
    Reinstate us in thy love.

    Chorus: 
    Hark! The herald-angels sing
    Glory to the new-born King.

Amen.
