# CACGHB 627
## SOLID ROCK 8.8.8.D. 
## For it was founded upon a Rock. - Matt. 7:25

1. My hope is built on nothing less
	Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
	No merit of my own I claim,
	But wholly lean on Jesus' name
	
Chorus:
	On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
	All other ground is sinking sand.

2. When long appears my toilsome race,
	I rest on His unchanging grace;
	In every high and stormy gale,
	My anchor holds within the veil

Chorus:
	On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
	All other ground is sinking sand.

---

3. His oath, His covenant, and blood,
	Support me in the whelming flood;
	When every earthly prop gives way,
	He then is all my hope and stay.

Chorus:
	On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
	All other ground is sinking sand.

4. When the last trumpet's voice shall sound,
	Oh may I then in Him be found.
	Robbed in His righteousness alone,
	Faultness to stand before the throne.

Chorus:
	On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
	All other ground is sinking sand.

Amen.
