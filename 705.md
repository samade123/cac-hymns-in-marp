# CACGHB 705 - MORE LOVE TO THEE 6.4.6.4.6.6.4.4. 
## Yea Lord, Thou knowest, that I love Thee. - John 21:15

1. More love to Thee, O Christ,
	More love to Thee
	Hear Thou the pray'r I make
	On bended knee
	This is my earnest plea
	More love, O Christ To Thee
	More love to Thee!
	More love to Thee!

---

2. Once earthly joy I crave,
	Sought peace and rest
	Now Thee alone I seek,
	Give what is best
	This all my pray'r shall be
	More love O Christ, to Thee,
	More love to Thee!
	More love to Thee!

---

3. Let sorrow do its work,
	Send grief and pain;
	Sweet are Thy messengers,
	Sweet their refrain,
	When they can sing with me
	More love, O Christ, to Thee,
	More love to Thee!
	More love to Thee.

---

4. Then shall my latest breath
	Whisper Thy praise;
	This be my parting cry
	My heart shall raise
	This still its pray'r shall be
	More love, O Christ, to Thee,
	More love to Thee!
	More love to Thee!

Amen
