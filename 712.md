# CACGHB 712

## Lord, from this time we cry to Thee

1. Lord, from this time we cry to Thee;
 Thou of our youth the Guide shalt be:
 Draw near and take us by the hand,
 And lead into the goodly land;
 With fire by night and cloud by day
 Be with us on our pilgrim way.

---

2. Forth to the wilderness we go,
 The tempter's wiles ordain'd to know;
 Though weak our arm, and fierce the fight,
 Still may we conquer through Thy might,
 Till, every foul assault subdued.
 Our souls are fed with angels' food.

---

3. In sorrow's cloud, in trouble's sea,
 Baptized afresh, O Lord, to Thee,
 While every joy that round us springs
 A Eucharistic gladness brings,
 Each journey done, each danger past
 Receive us to Thy rest at last.

---

4. Uphold our footsteps in Thy way,
 Nor suffer us in heart to stray;
 With patience bear, with counsel guide,
 From follies wean, from perils hide;
 In suff'ring soothe, in want defend,
 Confirm and stablish to the end.

Amen.
