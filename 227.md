# CAC Gospel Hymn Book - CACGHB 227 

1. Since Christ my soul from sin set free
    This world has been a heav'n to me
    And mild earth's sorrows and its woe
    'Tis heav'n my Jesus here to know


Chorus:
    O hallelujah, yes 'tis heav'n
    Tis heav'n to know my sins forgiv'n;
    On land or sea, what matters where
    Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there

---

2. Once heaven seemed a far-off place
    Till Jesus showed His smiling face,
    Now it's begun within my soul
    'Twill last while endless ages roll

Chorus:
    O hallelujah, yes 'tis heav'n
    Tis heav'n to know my sins forgiv'n;
    On land or sea, what matters where
    Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there

---

3. What matters where on earth we dwell?
    On mountain top, or in the dell?
    In cottage, or in mansion fair
    Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there.

Chorus:
    O hallelujah, yes 'tis heav'n
    Tis heav'n to know my sins forgiv'n;
    On land or sea, what matters where
    Where Jesus is, 'tis heaven there

Amen.
