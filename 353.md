# CACGHB 353 - Thy golden gates are lifted up
## (s. f.m.rd: sls: f. m m.rd lsf: m.r:-)

1. Thy golden gates are lifted up,
	The doors are opened wide;
	The king of Glory is gone in
	Unto His Father's side.


2. Thou art gone up before us, Lord,
	To make for us a place,
	That we may be where now Thou art,
	And see Thee face to face.

---

3. And ever on our earthly path
	A gleam of glory lies;
	A light still breaks behind the cloud
	That veiled Thee from our eyes.

4. Lift up our hearts, lift up our minds;
	Let Thy dear grace be given,
	That, while we wander here below,
	Our treasure be in Heaven.

---

5. That where Thou art, at God's right hand
	Our hope, our love may dwell
	Dwell Thou in us, that we may dwell
	For evermore in Thee.

Amen.
