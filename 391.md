1. Whoever receiveth the Crucified One,
	Whoever believeth on God's only son,
	A free and a perfect salvation shall have
	For He is abundantly able to save.  

Chorus:
My brother, the Master is calling for thee;
His grace and His mercy are won drously free!
His blood as a ransom for sinners He gave,
And He is abundantly able to save.

2. Whoever receiveth the message of God,
	And trusts in the power of the soul cleansing blood,
	A full and eternal redemption shall have
	For He is both able and willing to save.  

Chorus:
My brother, the Master is calling for thee;
His grace and His mercy are won drously free!
His blood as a ransom for sinners He gave,
And He is abundantly able to save.

3. Whoever repents and forsakes ev'ry sin,
	And opens his heart for the Lord to come in.
	A present and perfect salvation shall have:
	For Jesus is ready this moment to save.  

Chorus:
My brother, the Master is calling for thee;
His grace and His mercy are won drously free!
His blood as a ransom for sinners He gave,
And He is abundantly able to save.

Amen.
