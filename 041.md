# CACGHB 041
## We are never, never weary of the grand old song

1. We are never, never weary of the grand old song;
    Glory to God, Hallelujah;
    We can sing it loud as ever, with our faith more strong
    Glory to God, Hallelujah!

Chorus:
    O the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing
    For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing;
    We are going by and by to the palace of the king;
    Glory to God, Hallelujah.

2. We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love,
    Glory to God, Hallelujah!
    We are rising on its pinions to the hills above;
    Glory to God, Hallelujah!


Chorus:
    O the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing
    For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing;
    We are going by and by to the palace of the king;
    Glory to God, Hallelujah.

3. We are going to a palace that is built of gold
    Glory to God, Hallelujah!
    Where the King in all His splendour we shall soon behold;
    Glory to God, Hallelujah!


Chorus:
    O the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing
    For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing;
    We are going by and by to the palace of the king;
    Glory to God, Hallelujah.

4. There we'll shout redeeming mercy in a glad new song,
    Glory to God, Hallelujah!
    There we'll sing the praise of Jesus with the blood-wash'd throng,
    Glory to God, Hallelujah!


Chorus:
    O the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing
    For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing;
    We are going by and by to the palace of the king;
    Glory to God, Hallelujah.

Amen.
