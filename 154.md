# CACGHB 154 - O come, all ye faithful,

1. O come, all ye faithful,
    Joyful and triumphant,
    Come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
    Come and behold Him
    Born the King of angels.

    O come let us adore Him,
    O come let us adore Him,
    O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.



2. True God of true God,
    Light of Light eternal,
    Lo! He abhors not the Virgin's womb,
    Son of the Father,
    Begotten, not created.
 

    O come let us adore Him,
    O come let us adore Him,
    O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.

3. Sing choirs of angels,
    Sing in exultation,
    Sing, all ye citizen of heav'n above,
    Glory to God
    In the highest.


    O come let us adore Him,
    O come let us adore Him,
    O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.


4. Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
    Born this happy morning,
    Jesus, to Thee be glory given,
    Word of the Father,
    Now in flesh appearing.


    O come let us adore Him,
    O come let us adore Him,
    O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.

Amen.
