# CAC Gospel Hymn Book - CACGHB 708
## He Leadeth Me

---

## Verse 1
He leadeth, me O blessed thought!\
O words with heav'nly comfort fraught!\
Whate'er I do, where'er I be,\
Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

#### Chorus
He leadeth me, He leadeth me!\
By His own hand He leadeth me!\
His faithful follower I would be,\
For by His hand He leadeth me.

---

## Verse 2
Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,\
Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,\
By waters still, o'er troubl'd sea, -\
Still 'tis His hand that leadeth me!

#### Chorus
He leadeth me, He leadeth me!\
By His own hand He leadeth me!\
His faithful follower I would be,\
For by His hand He leadeth me.

---

## Verse 3
Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,\
Nor ever murmur nor repine\
Content, whatever lot I see,\
Since 'tis my God that leadeth me!

#### Chorus
He leadeth me, He leadeth me!\
By His own hand He leadeth me!\
His faithful follower I would be,\
For by His hand He leadeth me.

---

## Verse 4
And when my task on earth is done,\
When, by Thy grace, the vict'ry's won,\
E'en death's cost wave I will not flee\
Since God through Jordan leadeth me.

#### Chorus
He leadeth me, He leadeth me!\
By His own hand He leadeth me!\
His faithful follower I would be,\
For by His hand He leadeth me.

Amen.
