# CACGHB 777
##  Jesus, my strength, my hope,

1. Jesus, my strength, my hope,
	On Thee I cast my care,
	With humble confidence look up,
	And know Thou hear'st my prayer
	Give me on Thee to wait,
	Till I can all things do,
	On Thee, almighty to create,
	Almighty to renew.

2. I want a godly fear,
	A quick-discerning eye
	That looks to Thee when sin is near.
	And sees the tempter fly:
	A spirit still prepared,
	And armed with jealous care,
	For ever standing on its guard
	And watching unto pray'r
---

3. I want a true regard,
	A single, steady aim,
	Unmoved by threat' ning or reward,
	To Thee and thy great name,
	A jealous, just concern
	For Thine immortal praise,
	A pure desire that all may learn
	And glorify Thy grace.

4. I rest upon Thy word;
	The promise is for me;
	My succour and salvation, Lord
	Shall surely come from Thee,
	But let me still abide,
	Nor from my hope remove,
	Till Thou my patient spirit guide
	Into Thy perfect love.

Amen.
