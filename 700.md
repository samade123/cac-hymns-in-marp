# CACGHB 700
##  God the Father lov'd the world

1. God the Father lov'd the world
	He loved the world so much
	That He sent His only Son
	Who died for the sinners
	For God has already known
	That I will offend Him
	His law and also His love
	Lovest thou Me also?

2. It is true, that God loves me
	This fact is without doubt
	Those who repent of their sins
	Have received salvation
	See how much Jesus suffers
	He was nailed to the cross
	Behold, His life blood flowing,
	Look, repent, sin no more.

3. Jesus underneath Thy Cross
	I'll wash away my sins
	Underneath Thy precious Cross
	I'll wash my sins away
	And when I shall behold Thee
	Up there upon Thy throne
	I shall not cease praising Thee
	Thy majesty and might.

Amen.
