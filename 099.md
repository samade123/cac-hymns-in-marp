# CACGHB 099

## Immortal, invisible, God only wise

1. Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
    In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
    Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
    Almighty, victorious, thy great name we praise.

---

2. Unresting unhasting, and silent as light,
    Nor wanting, nor mountains high soaring above,
    Thy clouds which are fountains of Goodness and love,
    Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.

---

3. To all life thou givest-to both great and small
    In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;
    We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,
    And wither and perish-but nought changeth Thee.

---

4. Great Father of Glory, pure Father of Light,
    Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight,
    All laud we would render, O help us to see,
    'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee.

Amen.
