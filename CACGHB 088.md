1. Praise, O praise our God and King!
    Hymns of adoration sing;
    For His mercies still endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure

2. Praise Him that He made the Sun
    Day by day his course to run
    For His mercies still endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure;

---

3. And the silver moon by night,
    Shining with her gentle light;
    For His mercies still endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure;

---

4. Praise Him that He gave the rain
    To mature the swelling grain;
    For His mercies, still endure
    Ever faithful, ever sure;

---

5. And hath bid the fruitful field
    Crops of precious increase yield;
    For His mercies still endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure,

---

6. Praise Him for our harvest store,
    He hath filled the garner floor,
    For His mercies still endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure,

---

7. And for richer food than this,
    Pledge of everlasting bliss;
    For His mercies still endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure.

---

8. Glory to our bounteous king
    Glory let creation sing!
    Glory to the Father, Son,
    And blest Spirit, Three in One.

Amen.
