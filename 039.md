# CACGHB 039 - Come, ye that love the Lord

1. Come, ye that love the Lord,
    And let your joys be known
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
    And thus surround the throne,
    And thus surround the throne,

Chorus:
    We're marching to Zion,
    Beautiful, beautiful Zion,
    We're marching upward to Zion,
    The beautiful city of God.

2. Let those refuse to sing
    Who never knew our God:
    But children of the heavenly King,
    But children of the heavenly king,
    Must speak their joys abroad,
    Must speak their joys abroad.

Chorus:
    We're marching to Zion,
    Beautiful, beautiful Zion,
    We're marching upward to Zion,
    The beautiful city of God.

3. The hill of Zion yields
    A thousand sacred sweets
    Before we reach the heav'nly fields
    Before we reach the heav'nly fields
    Or walk the golden streets,
    Or walk the golden streets.

Chorus:
    We're marching to Zion,
    Beautiful, beautiful Zion,
    We're marching upward to Zion,
    The beautiful city of God.

---

4. Then let our songs abound,
    And every tear be dry,
    We're marching through Immanuel's ground,
    We're marching through Immanuel's ground
    To fairer worlds on high
	To fairer worlds on high

Chorus:
    We're marching to Zion,
    Beautiful, beautiful Zion,
    We're marching upward to Zion,
    The beautiful city of God.

Amen.
