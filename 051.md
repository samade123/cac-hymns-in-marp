# CACGHB 051
##  This is the day of light

1. This is the day of light;
    Let there be light today
    O Day-spring rise upon our night,
    And chase its gloom away.

---

2. This is the day of rest:
    Our failing strength renew;
    On weary brain and troubled breast
    Shed Thou Thy fresh'ning dew.

3. This is the day of peace;
    Thy peace our spirits fill;
    Bid Thou the blasts of discord cease,
    The waves of strife be still

---

4. This is the day of pray'r
    Let earth to heav'n draw near;
    Lift up our hearts to seek Thee there;
    Come down to meet us here.

5. This is the first of days:
    Send forth Thy quick'ning breath,
    And wake dead souls to love and praise;
    O vanquisher of death!

Amen
