# CAC Gospel Hymn Book - CACGHB 259 

1. My soul is so happy in Jesus,
    For he is so precious to me,
    His voice it is music to hear it,
    His face it is heaven to see.

Chorus:   
    I am happy in Him,
    I am happy in Him,
    My soul with delight,
    He fills day and night,
    For I am happy in Him

---

2. He sought me so lone ere I knew Him,
    When wand'ring afar from the fold,
    Safe home in His arms He hath brought me
    To where there are pleasures untold.

Chorus:   
    I am happy in Him,
    I am happy in Him,
    My soul with delight,
    He fills day and night,
    For I am happy in Him

---

3. His love and His mercy surround me,
    His grace like a river doth flow;
    His spirit, to guide and to comfort,
    Is with me wherever I go.

Chorus:   
    I am happy in Him,
    I am happy in Him,
    My soul with delight,
    He fills day and night,
    For I am happy in Him

---

4. They say I shall someday be like Him,
    My crass and my burden lay down;
    Till then I will ever be faithful,
    In gathering gems for His crown.

Chorus:   
    I am happy in Him,
    I am happy in Him,
    My soul with delight,
    He fills day and night,
    For I am happy in Him

Amen
