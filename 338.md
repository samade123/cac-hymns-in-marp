# CACGHB 338 - Thine be the Glory, 

## MACCABEAUS 10.11.11.11. AND REF.
## OUGHT NOT CHRIST TO HAVE SUFFERED THESE THINGS AND TO ENTER INTO HIS GLORY. LUK.24:26

1. Thine be the glory, risen conquering Son
	Endless is the victory Thou o'er, death hast won
	Angels in bright raiment roll'd the stone away
	Kept the folded grace-clothes where Thy body lay.
	Thine be the glory, risen, conquering son
	Endless is the victory
	Thou o'er death hast won.

2. Lo! Jesus meet us risen from the tomb;
	Loving He greets us, scatters fear and gloom
	Let the church with gladness hymns of triumph sing
	For her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting.
	Thine be the glory, risen, conquering son
	Endless is the victory
	Thou o'er death hast won.

---

3. No more we doubt Thee, Glorious
	Prince of life;
	Life is nought without Thee aid us in our strife
	Make us move than conquerors through Thy deathless love
	Bring us safe through Jordan toothy home above.
	Thine be the glory, risen, conquering son
	Endless is the victory
	Thou o'er death hast won.

Amen.
