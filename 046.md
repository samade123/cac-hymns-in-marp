# CACGHB 046
## Jesus we love to meet On this Thy holy day

1. Jesus we love to meet
    On this Thy holy day
    We gather round Thy throne
    On this Thy holy day,
    Thou art our heav'nly Friend
    Our pray'rs ascend to Thee
    Look on our spirits, Lord
    On this thy holy day.

2. Let us shake off dull sloth
    On this Thy holy day
    We kneel in reverence, Lord
    On this Thy holy day
    Our sins may Thou forgive
    And may Thou teach us, Lord
    To worship as we ought
    On this Thy holy day.

3. We listen to Thy word
    On this Thy holy day
    Bless all the words we hear
    On this thy holy day.
    As we part, be with us
    Thy salvation impart
    To every heart, dear Lord
    On this Thy holy day.

Amen.
