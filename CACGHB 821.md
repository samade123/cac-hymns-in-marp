## Our eyes wait upon the Lord our God. - Ps.123:2

<!-- slide -->
1. My faith looks up o Thee,
	Thou lamb of Calvary,
	Saviour divine.
	Now hear me while I pray;
	Take all my guilt away;
	O let me from this day
	Be wholly Thine.

    > Saviour! Saviour! Hear my humble cry.
	And while others Thou art calling,
	Do not pass me by.

2. May Thy rich grace impart
	Strength to my fainting heart,
	My zeal inspire:
	As Thou hast died for me,
	O may my love to Thee
	Pure, warm, and changeless be,
	A living fire.

    > Saviour! Saviour! Hear my humble cry.
	And while others Thou art calling,
	Do not pass me by.

3. While life's dark maze I tread,
	And griefs around me spread,
	Be Thou my guide;
	Bid darkness turn to day,
	Wipe sorrow's tears away,
	Nor let me ever stray
	From Thee aside.

    > Saviour! Saviour! Hear my humble cry.
	And while others Thou art calling,
	Do not pass me by.

<!-- slide -->
4. When ends life's transient dream,
	When death's cold, sullen stream
	Shall o'er me roll,
	Blest saviour, then in love,
	Fear and distrust remove ;
	O bear me safe above,
	A ransom'd soul.

    > Saviour! Saviour! Hear my humble cry.
	And while others Thou art calling,
	Do not pass me by.

Amen.
