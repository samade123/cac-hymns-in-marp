# CACGHB 821 - My faith looks up o Thee
## Our eyes wait upon the Lord our God. - Ps.123:2

1. My faith looks up o Thee,
	Thou lamb of Calvary,
	Saviour divine.
	Now hear me while I pray;
	Take all my guilt away;
	O let me from this day
	Be wholly Thine.



2. May Thy rich grace impart
	Strength to my fainting heart,
	My zeal inspire:
	As Thou hast died for me,
	O may my love to Thee
	Pure, warm, and changeless be,
	A living fire.

---

3. While life's dark maze I tread,
	And griefs around me spread,
	Be Thou my guide;
	Bid darkness turn to day,
	Wipe sorrow's tears away,
	Nor let me ever stray
	From Thee aside


4. When ends life's transient dream.
	When death's cold, sullen stream
	Shall o'er me roll,
	Blest saviour, then in love,
	Fear and distrust remove ;
	O bear me safe above,
	A ransom'd soul.

Amen.
