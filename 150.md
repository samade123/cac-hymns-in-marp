# CACGHB 150 - Angels from the realms of glory

1. Angels from the realms of glory
    Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
    Ye, who sang creation's story,
    Now proclaim Messaih's birth,
	
	
    Come and worship,
    Worship Christ the new-born King.

2. Shepherds in the field abiding,
    Watching o'er your flocks by night,
    God with man is now residing,
    Yonder shines the infant light;

    Come and worship,
    Worship Christ the new-born King.

3. Sages, leave your contemplations;
    Brighter visions beam afar,
    Seek the great Desire of nations,
    Ye have seen His natal star,

    Come and worship,
    Worship Christ the new-born King.

4. Saints, before the altar bending
    Watching long with hope and fear,
    Suddenly the Lord, descending,
    In His temple shall appear,

    Come and worship,
    Worship Christ the new-born King.

---

5. All creation, join in praising
    God the Father, Spirit, Son â€“
    Evermore your voices raising
    To th' Eternal Three in One.


    Come and worship,
    Worship Christ the new-born King.


Amen.
