# CACGHB 085


1. Father of heav'n above,
    Dwelling in light and love,
    Ancient of days,
    Light unapproachable,
    Love inexpressible,
    Thee, the invisible,
    Laud we and praise

2. Christ the eternal Word,
    Christ the incarnate Lord,
    Saviour of all,
    High throned above all height
    God of God, Light of Light,
    Increate infinite,
    On Thee we call.

3. O God, the Holy Ghost
    Whose fires of Pentecost
    Burn evermore,
    In this far wilderness
    Leave us not comfortless;
    Thee we love, Thee we bless,
    Thee we adore.

4. Strike your harps, heav'nly pow'rs:
    With your glad chants shall ours
    Trembling ascend:
    All praise, O God, to Thee,
    Three in One, One in Three,
    Praise everlastingly,
    World without end.

Amen.
