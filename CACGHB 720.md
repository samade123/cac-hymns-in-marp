# CAC Gospel Hymn Book - CACGHB 720
## Rise, ye children of salvation

1. Rise, ye children of salvation,  
    All who cleave to Christ the Head,  
    Wake, arise! O mighty nation,  
    Ere the foe on Zion tread.  
    
    *Chorus:*  
    Pour it forth a mighty anthem,
	Like the thunders of the sea
	Through the blood of Christ our ransom,
	More than conquerors are we
    More than conquerors are we  
    More than conquerors are we  
    Through the blood of Christ our ransom,  
    More than conquerors are we.

2. Saints and heroes long before us,  
    Firmly on this ground have stood;  
    See their banners waving o'er us,  
    Conquerors through Jesus' blood.  
    
    *Chorus:*  
    Pour it forth a mighty anthem,
	Like the thunders of the sea
	Through the blood of Christ our ransom,
	More than conquerors are we
    More than conquerors are we  
    More than conquerors are we  
    Through the blood of Christ our ransom,  
    More than conquerors are we.

3. Deathless, we are all unfearing,  
    Life laid up with Christ in God;  
    In the morn of His appearing  
    Floweth forth a glory flood.  
    
    *Chorus:*  
    Pour it forth a mighty anthem,
	Like the thunders of the sea
	Through the blood of Christ our ransom,
	More than conquerors are we
    More than conquerors are we  
    More than conquerors are we  
    Through the blood of Christ our ransom,  
    More than conquerors are we.

4. Soon we all shall stand before Him,  
    See and know our glorious Lord;  
    Soon in joy and light adore Him,  
    Each receiving his reward.  
    
    *Chorus:*  
    Pour it forth a mighty anthem,
	Like the thunders of the sea
	Through the blood of Christ our ransom,
	More than conquerors are we
    More than conquerors are we  
    More than conquerors are we  
    Through the blood of Christ our ransom,  
    More than conquerors are we.


Amen.
